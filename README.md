# Census Data Analysis for Strategic Urban Planning

## Overview
This project performs a detailed analysis of census data to guide government decisions on urban development and resource allocation. The study focuses on cleaning and analyzing demographic, household, and commuting data to provide actionable insights for long-term urban planning.

## Features
### Data Cleaning
- Addressed missing and erroneous values in fields such as:
  - **Age**: Converted strings to integers, imputed missing values with mean or logical substitutes.
  - **Marital Status**: Rectified null entries and logically adjusted illegal entries.
  - **Religion**: Standardized ambiguous or irrelevant entries.
  - **Occupation**: Categorized blank values based on age and plausible assumptions.

### Data Analysis
- **Demographics**:
  - Constructed age pyramids to assess population growth trends.
  - Calculated birth and death rates to evaluate population dynamics.
- **Household Occupancy**:
  - Analyzed under-occupied and over-occupied housing based on street-level data.
  - Proposed housing optimization strategies.
- **Religious and Occupational Trends**:
  - Explored religious affiliations and their distribution across age groups.
  - Analyzed employment data to identify unemployment trends and potential for skill development.
- **Commuting Patterns**:
  - Segregated population into commuting and non-commuting groups.
  - Highlighted the need for improved transport infrastructure.

## Recommendations
### Infrastructure Development
- Construct a **train station** to support commuters and reduce traffic congestion.

### Economic Growth
- Establish a **skill development center** to combat unemployment and foster entrepreneurship.

### Housing Optimization
- Strategically address **over-occupied** and **under-occupied** housing to improve living conditions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Database Management**: SQL
- **Statistical Methods**: Birth/death rate analysis, age pyramids
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, bar charts, and demographic graphs

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/census-data-analysis.git
   cd census-data-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure access to the census dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
1. Preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Perform analysis:
   ```bash
   python analyze.py
   ```
3. Generate visualizations:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```

## Results
- **Population Growth**:
  - Increasing population with a high birth-to-death rate ratio.
- **Commuting Patterns**:
  - Majority of the population commutes, highlighting the need for a train station.
- **Housing**:
  - Over-occupied housing is a significant issue, requiring optimization.
- **Employment**:
  - Skill development programs can help address unemployment.
